NIM Composition Space Optimization: A small playground for learning nim language through a small scientific library for optimizing the choice of chemical elements that maximizes available data from the literature given a limit on their number. It is designed with high entropy alloys (HEAs) and other compositionally complex materials (CCMs) in mind, but applicable to large datasets of steels and so on.

Part of the [**ULTERA Project**](https://ultera.org) carried under the [**DOE ARPA-E ULTIMATE program**](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/ultimate) that aims to develop a new generation of materials for turbine blades in gas turbines and related applications.
