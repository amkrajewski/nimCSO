# Quick Start

This is a quick start guide to get you up and running with the nimCSO software. If you are running it in the Codespaces environment, you should now open the 
[**`quickstart.ipynb`**](quickstart.ipynb) notebook inside this directory and follow the instructions there. **Please note, once propted to select a kernel (after running the first code cell), you should select the `base` kernel (which should show up as recommended).**
