# Summary

The Compositionally Complex Materials (CCMs), and their matal-focused subset of High Entropy Alloys (HEAs), belong to a rapidly emerging class of materials, first proposed by [@Cantor2004] and [@Yeh2004]. Contrary to more traditional materials, they contain a large number of chemical elements, typically 4-9 in similar proportions, in hope to thermodynamically stabilize the material by increasing its configurational entropy, by up to $\Delta S_{conf} = \Sigma_i^N x_i \ln{x_i}$ for ideally random mixing of $N$ elements with fractions $x_i$.
