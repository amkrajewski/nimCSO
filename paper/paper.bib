   abstract = {Multicomponent alloys containing several components in equal atomic proportions have been manufactured by casting and melt spinning, and their microstructures and properties have been investigated by a combination of optical microscopy, 
   scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, X-ray diffractrometry and microhardness measurements. Alloys containing 16 and 20 components in equal proportions are multiphase, crystalline and brittle both as-cast and after melt 
   spinning. A five component Fe20Cr20Mn20Ni20Co20 alloy forms a single fcc solid solution which solidifies dendritically. A wide range of other six to nine component late transition metal rich multicomponent alloys exhibit the same majority fcc primary 
   dendritic phase, which can dissolve substantial amounts of other transition metals such as Nb, Ti and V. More electronegative elements such as Cu and Ge are less stable in the fcc dendrites and are rejected into the interdendritic regions. The total 
   number of phases is always well below the maximum equilibrium number allowed by the Gibbs phase rule, and even further below the maximum number allowed under non-equilibrium solidification conditions. Glassy structures are not formed by casting or 
   melt spinning of late transition metal rich multicomponent alloys, indicating that the confusion principle does not apply, and other factors are more important in promoting glass formation. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Refractory multicomponent alloys (RMCAs) have garnered attention as potential materials for high-temperature structural applications, due to their excellent mechanical properties. However, conventional alloy design has limitations in terms of constrained compositional space and a lack of computational databases with adequate coverage. To address this, we present a design framework that leverages machine learning (ML), the CALculation of PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) method, and experimental validation to efficiently develop refractory alloys. The present study focuses on the Mo-Nb-W ternary system. Six ternary alloys were inversely designed by means of the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) and fabricated via arc melting. The ternary alloys exhibit a single BCC phase which is consistent with CALPHAD calculations as well as Scheil simulations. The present interactive design loop between the ML surrogate model and experiments is demonstrated through the accurate hardness prediction, resulting in cGAN models capable of rapid exploration of the higher-order design space. The hardness of the Mo-Nb-W alloys is in the range of 5-6 GPa due to their solid solution strengthening.},

@article{Krajewski2024Nimplex,
   abstract = {Many disciplines of science and engineering deal with problems related to compositions, ranging from chemical compositions in materials science to portfolio compositions in economics. They exist in non-Euclidean simplex spaces, causing many 
   standard tools to be incorrect or inefficient, which is significant in combinatorically or structurally challenging spaces exemplified by Compositionally Complex Materials (CCMs) and Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs). Here, we explore them conceptually 
   in terms of problem spaces and quantitatively in terms of computational feasibility. This work implements several essential methods specific to the compositional (simplex) spaces through a high-performance open-source library nimplex. Most significantly, 
   we derive and implement an algorithm for constructing a novel n-dimensional simplex graph data structure, which contains all discretized compositions and all possible neighbor-to-neighbor transitions as pointer arrays. Critically, no distance or neighborhood 
   calculations are performed, instead leveraging pure combinatorics and the ordering in procedurally generated simplex grids, keeping the algorithm $\mathcal\{O\}(N)$, so that graphs with billions of transitions take seconds to construct on a laptop. 
   Furthermore, we demonstrate how such graph representations can be combined to express path-planning problem spaces and to incorporate prior knowledge while keeping the problem space homogeneous. This allows for efficient deployment of existing high-performance 
   gradient descent, graph traversal search, and other path optimization algorithms.},

their day-to-day problems. All have admired Knuth for the breadth, clarity, accuracy, and good humor found in his books.To begin the fourth and later volumes of the set, and to update parts of the existing three, Knuth has created a series of small books called 
fascicles, which will be published at regular intervals. Each fascicle will encompass a section or more of wholly new or revised material. Ultimately, the content of these fascicles will be rolled up into the comprehensive, final versions of each volume, and the 
enormous undertaking that began in 1962 will be complete.Volume 4, Fascicle 1 This fascicle, enlivened by a wealth of Knuths typically enjoyable examples, describes basic broadword operations and an important class of data structures that can make computer 
programs run dozenseven thousandsof times faster. The author brings together and explains a substantial amount of previously scattered but eminently practical information known only to a few specialists. The book also includes nearly five-hundred exercises for 
self-study, with detailed answers given in nearly every case; dozens of these exercises present original material that has never before been published. Simply put, this fascicle is a must-have for anybody who is faced with tough problems of a combinatorial flavor. 
It demonstrates how ordinary programmers can make use of powerful techniques that heretofore seemed to be available only to people who used specialized languages and software. It shows how ideas once thought to be far out are now ready to become a part of the

More specifically, we discuss feature selection in the context of deep neural network models to predict the stock price direction. We investigated a set of 124 technical analysis indicators used as explanatory variables in the recent literature and specialized trading websites. We applied three feature selection methods to shrink the feature set aiming to eliminate redundant information from similar indicators. Using daily data from stocks of seven global market indexes between 2008 and 2019, we tested neural networks with different settings of hidden layers and dropout rates. We compared various classification metrics, taking into account profitability and transaction costs levels to analyze economic gains. The results show that the variables were not uniformly chosen by the feature selection algorithms and that the out-of-sample accuracy rate of the prediction converged to two values – besides the 50% accuracy value that would suggest market efficiency, a “strange attractor” of 65% accuracy also was achieved consistently. We also found that the profitability of the strategies did not manage to significantly outperform the Buy-and-Hold strategy, even showing fairly large negative values for some hyperparameter combinations.},

   abstract = {<p>The paper deals with the estimation of a high dimensional covariance with a conditional sparsity structure and fast diverging eigenvalues. By assuming a sparse error covariance matrix in an approximate factor model, we allow for the presence of some cross-sectional correlation even after taking out common but unobservable factors. We introduce the principal orthogonal complement thresholding method ‘POET’ to explore such an approximate factor structure with sparsity. The POET-estimator includes the sample covariance matrix, the factor-based covariance matrix, the thresholding estimator and the adaptive thresholding estimator as specific examples. We provide mathematical insights when the factor analysis is approximately the same as the principal component analysis for high dimensional data. The rates of convergence of the sparse residual covariance matrix and the conditional sparse covariance matrix are studied under various norms. It is shown that the effect of estimating the unknown factors vanishes as the dimensionality increases. The uniform rates of convergence for the unobserved factors and their factor loadings are derived. The asymptotic results are also verified by extensive simulation studies. Finally, a real data application on portfolio allocation is presented.</p>},
