   abstract = {Developing ductile refractory alloys have remained a challenge. Decreasing the valence electron concentration of refractory alloys has been widely suggested for improving their ductility. However, Re has been used to ductilize W, which goes against the low valency suggestion. The thermodynamic stability of refractory alloys has never been considered while suggesting alloying elements to improve ductility. Here we use first-principles density functional theory simulations to unravel the role of enthalpy of formation in improving the intrinsic ductility of refractory alloys. The intrinsic ductility is assessed using the D-parameter , which is the ratio of surface energy and unstable stacking fault energy. We studied 25 equiatomic binary refractory alloys and found that positive enthalpy of formation improves ductility. The small positive enthalpy of formation could be compensated by sufficiently large entropy; hence the alloy is expected to be a single phase. Our present work explains the role of high-valency and low-valency alloying elements in improving the ductility of refractory alloys. These findings provide a path to design thermodynamically stable and intrinsically ductile high-temperature alloys.},

   abstract = {A new approach for the design of alloys is presented in this study. These "high-entropy alloys" with multi-principal elements were synthesized using well-developed processing technologies. Preliminary results demonstrate examples of the alloys with simple crystal structures, nanostructures, and promising mechanical properties. This approach may be opening a new era in materials science and engineering.},

@article{Cantor2004,
   abstract = {Multicomponent alloys containing several components in equal atomic proportions have been manufactured by casting and melt spinning, and their microstructures and properties have been investigated by a combination of optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, X-ray diffractrometry and microhardness measurements. Alloys containing 16 and 20 components in equal proportions are multiphase, crystalline and brittle both as-cast and after melt spinning. A five component Fe20Cr20Mn20Ni20Co20 alloy forms a single fcc solid solution which solidifies dendritically. A wide range of other six to nine component late transition metal rich multicomponent alloys exhibit the same majority fcc primary dendritic phase, which can dissolve substantial amounts of other transition metals such as Nb, Ti and V. More electronegative elements such as Cu and Ge are less stable in the fcc dendrites and are rejected into the interdendritic regions. The total number of phases is always well below the maximum equilibrium number allowed by the Gibbs phase rule, and even further below the maximum number allowed under non-equilibrium solidification conditions. Glassy structures are not formed by casting or melt spinning of late transition metal rich multicomponent alloys, indicating that the confusion principle does not apply, and other factors are more important in promoting glass formation.
